# HyperionDev Capstone Project 4


Let us assume that you work for a Nike warehouse. Your role is that of a store master, meaning you are responsible for managing the warehouse, and more importantly, doing stock-taking. To optimise your delivery time and for neater organisation, you have decided to use your Python knowledge to get an overview of what each stock-taking session entails.

Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list:
● Country
● Code
● Product
● Cost
● Quantity
● Value

Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use your program to do the following:
● Search products by code.
● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
● Determine the product with the highest value and stock it.
